# First goal
- Our first goal is to replicate the following command: django-admin startproject _______
    - So we need to figure out how to write TypeScript code that allows you to write commands on the command line to start a new project with the user's preferred name.

# Specific Goals for Part 1:
- Program a CLI tool
- Code a command that writes files or something. Just need our basic templates moved to the new "project".
    - We worry about the specifics of those files later.

# Development Notes
- So I know we can use things commander to help with command lines.
