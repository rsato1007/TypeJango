So we're trying to recreate the iconic framework from Python, but utilizing TypeScript instead.

# First things first
- Our first goal is figure out the super basic stuff I'll need to even get close to making this a reality.
- FIRST GOAL: create a command line....command that alows us to initialize a project.

# Other things to notate
- I briefly glanced at the Django repo and I noticed that it's object-oriented programming. Something to keep in mind when building your own version.
